Here, though B was not  capable \nby law of committing an offence, A is liable to be punished in the same manner as if B had been capable by law of committing an \noffence, and had committed murder, and he is therefore subj ect to the punishment of death.  \n(c) A instigates B to set fi re to a dwelling -house. B, in consequence of the unsoundness of his mind, being incapable of \nknowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is wrong or contrary to law, sets fire to the house in consequence of  A's \ninstigation.

Z says that he does not believe a word of A's deposition, and that A has \nperjured himself. A is moved to sudden passion by these word s, and kills Z.

Here, as soon as A has severed the tree in order to such taking, he has committed theft.  \n(b) A puts a bait for dogs in his pocket, and thus induces Z's dog to follow it. Here, if A's intention be dishonestly to take the \ndog out of Z's possession without Z's consent, A has committed theft as soon as  Z's dog has begun to fol low A.  \n(c) A meets a bullock carrying a box of treasure. He drives the bullock in a certain direction, in order that he may \ndishonestly take the treasure. As soon as the bullock begins to move, A has c ommitted theft of the treasure.  \n(d) A being Z's servant , and entrusted by Z with the care of Z's plate, dishonestly runs away with the plate, without Z's \nconsent. A has committed theft.  \n(e) Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A, the keeper of a warehouse, till Z shall return. A carries the plate to a \ngoldsmith and sells it. Here the plate was not in Z's possession. It could not therefore be taken out of Z's possession, and A has \nnot committed theft, though he may have comm itted criminal breach of trust.  \n(f) A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in t he house which Z occupies.

A, not owing to the jeweller any debt for \nwhich the jeweller might lawfully detain the watch as a security, enters the shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Z's  hand, \nand carries it away.

Both domestic and foreign investments \nwhich are fundamental to economic growth involve entering of parties into commercial \ncontracts. Often, contracts result in disputes that require proper and speedy adjudication \nby the Courts. This facilitates faster execution of contracts and reduces business costs \nand enhances returns on investment. \nIn order to ensure that commercial contracts are enforced properly and business \nactivities continue unimpeded, the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 was enacted and \nCommercial Courts were established at the District levels. Five High Courts at Bombay, \nCalcutta, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh and Madras exercise Original Civil Jurisdiction \nwherein commercial divisions have been established.  The Act was amended in 2018. \nThe specified value of the commercial disputes to be adjudicated by the Commercial \nCourts is \u20b93 lakhs. The Act simplifies the process of settlement of dispute by introducing \nmechanism of Pre-Institution Mediation and Settlement (PIMS) where no interim relief \nis contemplated.\nThe mediation is to be conducted under the aegis of the State Legal Services Authority \nand District Legal Services Authority as provided under the National Legal Services \nAuthorities Act, 1987. On failure to resolve dispute through PIMS mechanism, the claimant \ncan approach the Courts for resolution of their commercial dispute. The amendments \nalso provide for establishment of Commercial Appellate Court at District level in such \nterritories wherein the High Courts do not enjoy ordinary original civil jurisdiction and the \ncommercial dispute case at the first instance is decided by a Court below the Court of \nDistrict Judge.IV.

In keeping with this spirit, the Department of Legal Affairs, which was hitherto \nconsidered a paper-heavy Department has made significant progress towards becoming \na paperless organization. VII: DIGITALISATION AND CYBER SECURITY\nFigure VII 1:\nCyber Cell\nOne of the key initiatives is the Legal Information Management and Briefing System \n(LIMBS), which is a web-based application to monitor all court cases where the Union of \nIndia is one of the parties. This application allows for real time monitoring of all Union of \nIndia related cases, while also managing the fees for all the Law Officers, Panel Counsels \nand Advocates associated with those cases. Earlier, officials had to line up in Courts \nsimply to find the status of an order, now the same is available at the click of a button.\nEqually significant is the initiative to digitalize the application process for Notaries. This \nhas directly benefitted the citizens by allowing them to apply for Notaries online. The \nlarger intent is to transform the entire end-to-end notarization process into a digitized \nsystem that can be easily accessed and executed from the comfort of home. This initiative \nis an important step towards the Government\u2019s public-centric approach and is also in line \nwith Vision 2047, while at the same time, enhancing the Ease of Doing Business.\n2022-23 AT A GLANCE\nAt A Glance-ENG_NEW.indd   43At A Glance-ENG_NEW.indd   43 6/14/2023   11:39:47 AM6/14/2023   11:39:47 AM", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1643, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "83e99093-6c68-479b-8aeb-09c10dd82424": {"__data__": {"id_": "83e99093-6c68-479b-8aeb-09c10dd82424", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "57", "file_name": "At_A_Glance-ENG.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7283e280-6d5e-4afc-9e97-6ce1d12d8a31", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "57", "file_name": "At_A_Glance-ENG.pdf"}, "hash": "b51a237360a4fb8ca33d2424bfc21d26f7bf3cdc183a266904ef8d6df12fabfb"}}, "hash": "b51a237360a4fb8ca33d2424bfc21d26f7bf3cdc183a266904ef8d6df12fabfb", "text": "44\nSTRIVES\nTO\nPROVIDEEnd User \nFramework\nOrganizational \nPolicy Framework\nCloud \nSecurityInformation \nSecurityNetwork \nSecurityInfrastructure \nFacilityDepartment of Legal Affairs has also made its website more comprehensive and \nuser friendly, easier to navigate with more readable text.

Globally, Indian parties account for a large number of arbitration \ncases. The Centre will provide fair and speedy resolution of arbitration cases at affordable \ncost and thus promotes institutional arbitration, without entangling the parties in the \nuncertainties associated with ad-hoc arbitrations. The Centre is strategically located at \nVasant Kunj in Delhi. The website of IIAC is operational since February 2023 and provides \nan overview of the Centre and its functioning.\nThe Centre was established vide Notification dated 13th June, 2022.

The changes are enabled \nto signal a paradigm shift for ensuring timely conclusion of arbitration proceedings, \nminimizing judicial intervention in the arbitral process and enforcement of arbitral awards. \nThe amendments are further aimed at promoting institutional arbitration, updating the \nlaw to reflect best global practices and resolve ambiguities thereby establishing an \narbitration ecosystem where arbitral institutions can flourish.\nThe Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2019 provides for establishment of \nthe Arbitration Council of India (Council) which will frame, review and update norms to \nensure satisfactory levels of arbitration and will also frame policies governing the grading \nof arbitral institutions. The Council will lay down norms to bring uniformity of standards \namong the arbitral institutions in the country.\nThe establishment of the Council further minimizes court intervention in arbitration matters \nby providing that parties may approach the Supreme Court and High Courts designated \nand Council graded arbitral institutions for the purpose of appointment of arbitrators \nunder section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, thereby reducing the time \nand expenses of the concerned parties.

The said Rules provide for expeditious disposal of all \nmatters pending before the Appellate Tribunal. The Appellate Tribunal functions as the \nfinal fact-finding authority not only in the matters concerning Income-Tax but also in all \nmatters of taxation.\nThe matters, which the Appellate Tribunal disposes, involve revenue to the tune of \nseveral crores. The Tribunal is entrusted with the responsible task of deciding intricate \nquestions of law and fact.                      \nThe presence of both the Judicial and Accountant Members ensures that questions \nof law and fact, which arise for consideration are properly enquired into and weighed \nproperly. The Appellate Tribunal allows the representatives of both the parties to appear \nbefore it and hears them before passing any order. The Members hear the parties, peruse \nthe evidence on record, make their own notes, refer to the authorities cited at the Bar, \nconfer among themselves and then pass final orders. \nPENDENCY OF APPEALS\nNecessary instructions were issued to all the Benches to scrutinize and identify cases \nwhich are covered by decisions of I.T.A.T., High Courts, and the Supreme Court and post \nthem on priority basis. This includes group and small matters. The members of the Bar \nwere also requested to bring all such covered cases to the notice of I.T.A.T., for out of turn \nposting. Besides, appeals dealing with Search and Seizure matters and appeals against \nOrder passed under section 263 by the Administrative Commissioners are prioritised.  \nSimilarly, appeals against the denial of registration to charitable institutions under section \n12A and denial of recognition under Section 80G are also prioritised. Appeals of senior \ncitizens are also taken up for priority hearing. Further, according to amendments made in \nIncome Tax Act, 1961 by Finance Act, 2015, appeals involving assessed income upto \u20b950 \nlakh can be heard by a single member Bench.\nThe bar graph shows the result of efforts taken by ITAT to effectively reduce the \npending number of cases from 2018 to 2023.2022-23 AT A GLANCE\nAt A Glance-ENG_NEW.indd   73At A Glance-ENG_NEW.indd   73 6/14/2023   11:40:00 AM6/14/2023   11:40:00 AM", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2585, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9a086bba-2966-46c5-a8bf-377d43e07bcd": {"__data__": {"id_": "9a086bba-2966-46c5-a8bf-377d43e07bcd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "87", "file_name": "At_A_Glance-ENG.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cd73f612-74f0-4aee-81ac-103dde37de56", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "87", "file_name": "At_A_Glance-ENG.pdf"}, "hash": "1dd430f812e62ff4f18905e9c68673aa7e0a87172049561628af1fda31ee4eba"}}, "hash": "1dd430f812e62ff4f18905e9c68673aa7e0a87172049561628af1fda31ee4eba", "text": "74Figure XII-2:\nPendency of ITAT cases\nGraphical Representation of Decreasing Number of Pending Cases\n20222023\n2021\n2020\n2019\n20183832436461\n7233\n390839096\n21364\n54315\n40473\n15046\n24256\n1461779754\n89412\n53160\n50991\n51347\n5080791419\nPendency Disposal Cases Institution of Cases\nDIGITIZATION\nInitiated in early 2000s, digitization has taken great momentum in living up to the motto \nof \u201cNishpaksh Sulabh Satvar Nyay.\u201d  Various efforts have been detailed as follows:\na.

In this process, the Commission \ninvolves professional bodies and academic institutions. Seminars and workshops are \norganised to elicit critical opinions on proposed strategies for reform. The Commission \nalways welcomes suggestions from any person, institution, or organization on the issues \nunder consideration.\nFinal Report:  Once the data and suggestions are assimilated, the Commission evaluates \nthem, and the information is used for appropriate incorporation in the report which is \nwritten under the guidance of the Chairperson and Members of the Commission. It is \nthen subjected to scrutiny by the entire Commission in a meeting.  Once the Report and \nsummary are finalised, the Commission may decide to prepare a draft amendment or a \nnew Bill which may be appended to its Report. Thereafter, the final report is submitted to \nthe Central Government for consideration.\nFollow-up:  The Reports of the Law Commission are laid before the Parliament from time \nto time by the Department of Legal Affairs, Ministry of Law and Justice and forwarded to \nthe concerned administrative Departments/Ministries for implementation. They are acted \nupon by concerned Departments/ Ministries depending on the Government's decision. \nInvariably, the reports are cited in Courts, Parliamentary Standing Committees, and in \nacademic and public discourses.2022-23 AT A GLANCE\nAt A Glance-ENG_NEW.indd   85At A Glance-ENG_NEW.indd   85 6/14/2023   11:40:04 AM6/14/2023   11:40:04 AM", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3092, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4de9cf6a-eacd-4199-aea4-ecdd1946bde5": {"__data__": {"id_": "4de9cf6a-eacd-4199-aea4-ecdd1946bde5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "99", "file_name": "At_A_Glance-ENG.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b47dcce1-40ea-488e-9820-2cacc7e3c3bd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "99", "file_name": "At_A_Glance-ENG.pdf"}, "hash": "e07158d1170e0eda0c106d38e1e07490aa4b7fce6faa57104b185c573b475b3e"}}, "hash": "e07158d1170e0eda0c106d38e1e07490aa4b7fce6faa57104b185c573b475b3e", "text": "86GENDER REPRESENTATION \nThe number of female and male employees employed in the Commission is \nmentioned below:\nA total number of 37 employees are employed in the Law Commission, out of whom \nseven are female employees (i.e. 18%) and the rest are male employees (i.e. 82%).\nRIGHT TO INFORMATION\nThe Right to Information Act, 2005 is strictly adhered to in the Law Commission of \nIndia.
